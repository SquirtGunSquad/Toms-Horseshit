Tom will upload code here. He probably tested it?

THE TISP CLASSIFIER

THIS SORTS GOOD FROM EVIL USING HARD THRESHOLDING. VERY METAL.
GIVEN SOME INPUT DATA, THE MODEL USES GRADIENT DESCENT ON THE WEIGHTS AND GRADUALLY REMOVES INSIGNIFICANT WEIGHTS.
IT DETERMINES WHETHER THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT BY WHETHER THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE WEIGHT IS GREATER THAN SOME SPECIFIED LAMBDA.
IT ALSO CONVENIENTLY OUTPUTS SEVERAL PLOTS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON AND IF IT'S EVEN WORKING OR NOT.
THE ALGORITHM WILL ITERATE r TIMES. PICK SOMETHING LESS THAN 1000.

IF YOU GET ERRORS IT'S YOUR FAULT.
